abstract = {Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been used in Information Re-
trieval. The results are not encouraging. Simple methods (stopwording, porter-style stem-
ming, etc.) usually yield significant improvements, while higher-level processing (chunk-
ing, parsing, word sense disambiguation, etc.) only yield very small improvements or even
a decrease in accuracy. At the same time, higher-level methods increase the processing and
storage cost dramatically. This makes them hard to use on large collections. We review
NLP techniques and come to the conclusion that (a) NLP needs to be optimized for IR in
order to be effective and (b) document retrieval is not an ideal application for NLP, at least
given the current state-of-the-art in NLP. Other IR-related tasks, e.g., question answering
and information extraction, seem to be better suited.},

We have designed a new performance plot called the CROC curve with an associated statistic: the area under the curve. Our CROC curve supplements the widely used ROC curve in recommender system evaluation by discovering performance characteristics that standard ROC evaluation often ignores. Empirical studies on two domains and including several recommender system algorithms demonstrate that combining ROC and CROC curves in evaluation can lead to a more informed characterization of performance than using either curve alone.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems make suggestions about artifacts to a user. For instance, they may predict whether a user would be interested in seeing a particular movie. Social recomendation methods collect ratings of artifacts from many individuals and use nearest-neighbor techniques to make recommendations to a user concerning new artifacts. However, these methods do not use the significant amount of other information that is often available about the nature of each artifact --- such as cast lists or movie reviews, for example. This paper presents an inductive learning approach to recommendation that is able to use both ratings information and other forms of information about each artifact in predicting user preferences. We show that our method outperforms an existing social-filtering method in the domain of movie recommendations on a dataset of more than 45,000 movie ratings collected from a community of over 250 users.

Most existing recommender systems use collaborative filtering methods that base recommendations on other users' preferences. By contrast, content-based methods use information about an item itself to make suggestions. This approach has the advantage of being able to recommend previously unrated items to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its recommendations. We describe a content-based book recommending system that utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text categorization.

But this world also is one of endless choice:  how can we select from a huge universe of items of widely varying quality?  Computational recommender systems have emerged to address this issue. They enable  people to share their opinions and benefit from each other's experience. We present a  framework for understanding recommender systems and survey a number of distinct  approaches in terms of this framework. We also suggest two main research challenges:  (1) helping people form communities of interest while respecting personal privacy, and  (2) developing algorithms that combine multiple types of information to compute  recommendations.

abstract = {We have developed a method for recommending items that combines content and collaborative data under a single probabilistic framework. We benchmark our algorithm against a nave Bayes classifier on the cold-start problem, where we wish to recommend items that no one in the community has yet rated. We systematically explore three testing methodologies using a publicly available data set, and explain how these methods apply to specific real-world applications. We advocate heuristic recommenders when benchmarking to give competent baseline performance. We introduce a new performance metric, the CROC curve, and demonstrate empirically that the various components of our testing strategy combine to obtain deeper understanding of the performance characteristics of recommender systems. Though the emphasis of our testing is on cold-start recommending, our methods for recommending and evaluation are general.},

@inproceedings{Haav2001,
abstract = {             In order to solve the problem of information overkill on the web
current information retrieval tools need to be improved. Much more
"intelligence" should be embedded to search tools to manage effectively search,
retrieval, filtering and presenting relevant information. This can be done by
concept-based (or ontology driven) information retrieval, which is considered as
one of the high-impact technologies for the next ten years. Nevertheless, most
of commercial products of search and retrieval category do not report about
concept-based search features. The paper provides an overview of concept-
based information retrieval techniques and software tools currently available as
prototypes or commercial products. Tools are evaluated using feature
classification, which incorporates general characteristics of tools and their
Information retrieval features.

abstract = {Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been used in Information Re-
trieval. The results are not encouraging. Simple methods (stopwording, porter-style stem-
ming, etc.) usually yield significant improvements, while higher-level processing (chunk-
ing, parsing, word sense disambiguation, etc.) only yield very small improvements or even
a decrease in accuracy. At the same time, higher-level methods increase the processing and
storage cost dramatically. This makes them hard to use on large collections. We review
NLP techniques and come to the conclusion that (a) NLP needs to be optimized for IR in
order to be effective and (b) document retrieval is not an ideal application for NLP, at least
given the current state-of-the-art in NLP. Other IR-related tasks, e.g., question answering
and information extraction, seem to be better suited.},

Our CROC curve supplements the widely used ROC curve in recommender system evaluation by discovering performance characteristics that standard ROC evaluation often ignores. Empirical studies on two domains and including several recommender system algorithms demonstrate that combining ROC and CROC curves in evaluation can lead to a more informed characterization of performance than using either curve alone.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems make suggestions about artifacts to a user. For instance, they may predict whether a user would be interested in seeing a particular movie. Social recomendation methods collect ratings of artifacts from many individuals and use nearest-neighbor techniques to make recommendations to a user concerning new artifacts. However, these methods do not use the significant amount of other information that is often available about the nature of each artifact --- such as cast lists or movie reviews, for example. This paper presents an inductive learning approach to recommendation that is able to use both ratings information and other forms of information about each artifact in predicting user preferences. We show that our method outperforms an existing social-filtering method in the domain of movie recommendations on a dataset of more than 45,000 movie ratings collected from a community of over 250 users.

Most existing recommender systems use collaborative filtering methods that base recommendations on other users' preferences. By contrast, content-based methods use information about an item itself to make suggestions. This approach has the advantage of being able to recommend previously unrated items to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its recommendations. We describe a content-based book recommending system that utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text categorization. Initial experimental results demonstrate that this approach can produce accurate recommendations.},

abstract = {Science (EECS) and the OSU Libraries are working together on a project to improve the effectiveness and accessibility of digital information created and collected by academic libraries. This project focuses on making digital resources more accessible through an innovative search interface that incorporates collaborative filtering. New approaches to search interfaces will help make the growing wealth of online content more accessible and useful. This paper discusses the problem, explains how collaborative filtering works, describes the System for Electronic Recommendation Filtering (SERF), and then presents initial results from an installation in the OSU Libraries. The productive collaboration at OSU between the Libraries and EECS portends the future of development of search systems; by working together, we can harness the expertise of librarians, computer scientists, and information users to develop more useful search interfaces and increase access to the libraries â€™ resources and services.},

abstract = {Recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making personalized  recommendations for information, products or services during a live interaction. These systems, especially  the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web.  The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites  in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality  recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and  achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative filtering systems the  amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system  technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very largescale  problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filteri...},

abstract = {The Internet and World Wide Web have brought us into a world of endless possibilities:  interactive Web sites to experience, music to listen to, conversations to participate in, and  every conceivable consumer item to order. But this world also is one of endless choice:  how can we select from a huge universe of items of widely varying quality?  Computational recommender systems have emerged to address this issue. They enable  people to share their opinions and benefit from each other's experience. We present a  framework for understanding recommender systems and survey a number of distinct  approaches in terms of this framework. We also suggest two main research challenges:  (1) helping people form communities of interest while respecting personal privacy, and  (2) developing algorithms that combine multiple types of information to compute  recommendations.

abstract = {We have developed a method for recommending items that combines content and collaborative data under a single probabilistic framework. We benchmark our algorithm against a nave Bayes classifier on the cold-start problem, where we wish to recommend items that no one in the community has yet rated. We systematically explore three testing methodologies using a publicly available data set, and explain how these methods apply to specific real-world applications. We advocate heuristic recommenders when benchmarking to give competent baseline performance. We introduce a new performance metric, the CROC curve, and demonstrate empirically that the various components of our testing strategy combine to obtain deeper understanding of the performance characteristics of recommender systems. Though the emphasis of our testing is on cold-start recommending, our methods for recommending and evaluation are general.},

The reactions are called annotations; they can be accessed by other peopleâ€™s filters. Tapestry is intended to handle any incoming stream of electronic documents and serves both as a mail filter and repository; its components are the indexer, document store, annotation store, filterer, little box, remailer, appraiser and reader/browser.

abstract = {This paper describes our first large-scale retrieval attempt in TREC-7 using DSIR. DSIR is a vector space based retrieval system in which semantic similarity between words, documents and queries, is interpreted in terms of geometric proximity of vectors in a multi-dimensional space. A co-occurrence matrix computed directly from the collection is used to build the underlying semantic space. We have implemented DSIR on a cluster of lowcost PC Pentium-class machines, and chosen the PVM message-passing library to manage our distributed DSIR version. Although our first adhoc retrieval results are quite poor in terms of recall-precision measure, we believe that more work and experiments have to be explored in order to obtain more promising retrieval performance.  1},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://infolab.stanford.edu/\~{}backrub/google.html To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description w...},

abstract = {             In order to solve the problem of information overkill on the web
current information retrieval tools need to be improved. Much more
"intelligence" should be embedded to search tools to manage effectively search,
retrieval, filtering and presenting relevant information. This can be done by
concept-based (or ontology driven) information retrieval, which is considered as
one of the high-impact technologies for the next ten years. Nevertheless, most
of commercial products of search and retrieval category do not report about
concept-based search features. The paper provides an overview of concept-
based information retrieval techniques and software tools currently available as
prototypes or commercial products. Tools are evaluated using feature
classification, which incorporates general characteristics of tools and their
Information retrieval features.

----------
            Concepts can be extracted from the text by categorisation. Crucial in thismodel is existence of a conceptual structure for mapping descriptions of informationobjects to concepts used in a query. If keywords or noun-phrases are used, then theyshould be mapped to concepts in a conceptual structure.},

@inproceedings{ThorstenBrants,
abstract = {Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been used in Information Re-
trieval. The results are not encouraging. Simple methods (stopwording, porter-style stem-
ming, etc.) usually yield significant improvements, while higher-level processing (chunk-
ing, parsing, word sense disambiguation, etc.) only yield very small improvements or even
a decrease in accuracy. At the same time, higher-level methods increase the processing and
storage cost dramatically. This makes them hard to use on large collections. We review
NLP techniques and come to the conclusion that (a) NLP needs to be optimized for IR in
order to be effective and (b) document retrieval is not an ideal application for NLP, at least
given the current state-of-the-art in NLP. Other IR-related tasks, e.g., question answering
and information extraction, seem to be better suited.},
